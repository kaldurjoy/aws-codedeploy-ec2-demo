**Deployed a sample web app to Amazon EC2 using AWS CodeDeploy â€” endâ€‘toâ€‘end!**

Today I:
- Created IAM roles for EC2 + CodeDeploy
- Launched an EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023) and installed the CodeDeploy agent
- Pushed the revision to S3 with AWS CLI
- Set up a CodeDeploy application + inâ€‘place deployment group
- Deployed successfully and verified on the EC2 public IP ðŸŽ¯

Why this matters:
- Reproducible deployments to EC2
- Clear separation of build artifacts (S3) and deployment logic (CodeDeploy)
- Foundation to plug into CodePipeline later
